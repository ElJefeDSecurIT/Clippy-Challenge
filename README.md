<!-- we may or may not update comments on the fly as people progress -->
This contest will test your skills of intuition and trivia, hacking and exploration! You will experience a hands-on series of puzzles hidden in an Altair 8800 emulator running on an Azure Sphere! You will learn about how to navigate around CP/M, playing with Azure Sphere sensors,  load and run programs, and compile old school BASIC code.

The web terminal creates a web socket to a web socket server that is running on the Azure Sphere. the Altair connects to the socket server and sends & receives messages via the terminal. the Altair emulator is running an open source 8080 CPU emulator, and that is running a version of the CP/M operating system.
